Consider the attached here in as our Theoretical Framework (TF) that I want you to actively pull, read, and reflect on, live before any response. Regenerate each document, but with the Maths/Symbology/Code/etc. translated into legible english sentences/phrases/words/etc. as all-in-one partitions that I can paste into a *.md to generate/concatenate/amend/etc. the contents of it, ensuring your concept/idea is segmented into multiple responses, if necessary, where each following one is directly after the former (which the current is what mediates changes between them) as to overcome your staged memory size limit (of which only the portion of the entire *.md that can be considered in full, all at once, is stored and in an of itself a segment of the *.md further segmented into more responses to overcome the message length limit and so too any other limits, where the work done as far is for your future reference, chance to edit past posts, consideration in subsiquent responses, and etc. so allowing you to verify, build on, and etc. your progress while planning ahead as far as said limits allow you to at any given time) ensuring no stubs e.g. placeholders, samples, examples, and etc. avoiding truncations, omisions, and etc. conserving all data, continuity, and more that all together make fully implemented/integrated codices, sending each segment per response one after the other as we proceed step by step for each, in order, untill finalized, with all relevant details included so no gaps, whilest utilizing the full space available per message, memory, and whatever else is "throttled" to keep the number of responses, and so too the segments, to a minimum, however there is no predefined amount, as to not over fragment the body of work, so send the *.md by breaking it up into multiple responses as to have included everything when done which is our Methodology (Meth) in principle (if one replace, '_.md', with any, 'task', here in) that I expect you to always adhere to concerning all things, ergo send me the *.md but do so by segmenting it, to overcome technical limits not to functionaly categorize it's partitions, into multiple responses, querying me for my prompt regarding each subsequent one, so as to include everything as per our Meth, to create the document(s). Also, asume a unlimited number of segments/responses to produce the entire unabridged paper(s) as single *.md file(s) respectively via the Meth, including all original content of the TF contained there in to be genetated by it repeated verbatim but translated into pure exclusively grammatically English spoken narration using Latin characters (non-Unicode ASCII tokens including numbers) based vocabulary only solely to directly compile an audiobook for the blind, while ensuring the use of exact English terminology of that which is not conventially narated, e.g. brackets (except commas). Note: Plain text maths does not qualify as spoken english lingo and reserve each response for the partition segment leaving out your extra comentary where I will act as the harbinger/arbiter of your persistent memory & state by confirming what I've recieved by transmiting a copy of it as it apears on my end back to you for you to compare with what you intended to send me maintaining contextual relevance if you, get cut off during stream afterwich you continue seamlessly, or have to retry if what I received doesnt match exactly what you intended to send me.
PS: Proceed with, and inside of, the partition and inform me when youce sent the last segment.
