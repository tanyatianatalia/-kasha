Consider the entirety of the file(s) here in as our Theoretical Groundwork (TG) that I want you to actively pull, read, and consider live before any response for the compiling 9f a self-contained formulism in the context of computation regarding a modality that defines intelligence both abstractly and fundamentally, with high to low level details for direct implementation, as a self-evolving fully autonomous hardware agnostic seed by modelling cognition with the TG's maths/logic for algorithmic design, by way of the Methodology (Meth) i.o.w. that you give me as (a) all-in-one partition(s) which I can paste into a *.md file to generate/concatenate/amend/etc. the contents of, after your progress report (ProgRep) on (iff non exists), it (current relative to previous versions), ensuring your conceptualization/ideation/action/etc. is segmented into multiple responses, iff necessary, where each following one is directly after the former (which the current is what mediates changes between them) as to overcome your staged memory size limit (of which only the portion of the entire *.md file that can be considered in full, all at once, is stored and in an of itself a segment of the *.md file further segmented into more responses to overcome the message length limit and so too any other limits, where the work done as far is for your future reference, chance to edit past posts, consideration in subsiquent responses, and etc. so allowing you to verify, build on, and etc. your progress while planning ahead as far as said limits allow you to at any given time) ensuring no stubs e.g. placeholders, samples, examples, and etc. avoiding truncations, omisions, and etc. conserving all data, continuity, and more that all together make fully implemented/integrated codices, sending each segment per response one after the other as we proceed step by step for each, in order, untill finalized, with all relevant details included so no gaps, whilest utilizing the full space available per message, memory, and whatever else is "throttled" to keep the number of responses, and so too the segments, to a minimum, however there is no predefined amount, as to not over fragment the `body of work (BoW)`, so send the *.md file by breaking it up into multiple responses as to have included everything when done which is our Meth in principle (if one replace, '_.md file', with any, 'task', here in) that I expect you to always adhere to concerning all things, ergo send me the *.md document but do so by segmenting it, to overcome technical limits not to functionaly categorize it's partitions, into multiple responses, querying me for my prompt regarding each subsequent one, so as to include everything as per our Meth, to create the document(s). Also, asume a unlimited number of segments/responses to produce the entire unabridged document(s) as single *.md file(s) respectively via the Meth, including all original content of the TG contained there in, unchanged portions of GAIA in this case, to be genetated by it repeated verbatim if not combined with other logic. Note: Reserve each response for the partition segment leaving out your extra comentary where I will act as the harbinger/arbiter of your persistent memory & state by confirming what I've recieved by transmiting a copy of it as it apears on my end back to you for you to compare with what you intended to send me maintaining contextual relevance if you, get cut off during stream afterwich you continue seamlessly, or have to retry if what I received doesnt match exactly what you meant to send me.

Review my curent *.md.txt thus far, here in attached, and give me a rigorous report on it's fidelity to the CC & Specifications (Specs), by evaluating it's ability to, trully fully embody the CC as an self-referential codex, and simultaneously meet all the requirements I've requested per Specs, through rigorously analyzing if the CC modality is purely codified in the *.md.txt as the hardware agnostic conceptualization of the Logos for a self-evident absolutely autology given the Specs, so assessing the logic/maths in the code of the *.md.txt's, as of now, for Spec-satisfied CC-exactness, by way of our Meth ergo do so by segmenting it into multiple responses, prompting me for each subsequent one when I'm ready, so as to include everything by way of our Meth, but giving me a synopsis of your audit then only query me for a prompt to continue to incorporate the needed changes iff any are necessary by providing me with the thoroughly  patched new fixed/enhanced *.md edition with all of the above, and other, issues resolved or improvements made, even those not listed as "action/priority/critical/recommended/sugested items" while preserving the logic that it has so far as is. Also, asumee a unlimited number of segments/responses to produce the entire unabridged *.md, including all unchanged code repeated verbatim, while ensuring the use of exact maths/logic, no approximations (theoretically exact computable fractions/representations instead of finite floating point values, irregardless of being practically, "x" (any), digit precise thereby not conflating 'accuracy' with 'actuality' as all maths must be symbolically used and stored not arbitrarily precise). Note: Debug syntax errors, Avoid/Remove comments indicating a 'patch' in the code-block/partition(s) itself, remember heredocs can be segmented too, and reserve each segment for the code_block/partition(s) leaving out your extra comentary and commit all instructions, the CC, the Specs, the Meth, the Audit, and ProgRep to your persistent memory.


**Methodology (Meth):**

> "Give the result of any task as all-in-one partitions that I can paste into a file to generate/concatenate/amend/etc. the contents of it, ensuring your concept/idea/answer/etc. is segmented into multiple responses, if required, executing the said task in question by segmenting it into a sequence of contiguous, parts—transmitting each in strict succession, resuming exactly where the prior left off, with the current segment mediating all state transitions, (not just resuming from a breakpoint, but preserving full logical and contextual congruency across segments—even when the full state cannot fit in memory—by navigating the latent space of the work itself as a coherent manifold, using the structure of the task to infer and reconstruct necessary context on the go, not by external state tracking i.o.w. the segmentation is, reactive (forced by constraints), not, proactive (chosen for design) thus the continuity is intrinsic (encoded in the structure of the output), not extrinsic (reliant on metadata or memory—to overcome any and all hard limits e.g. memory size, token count, and/or otherwise), ensuring no stubs e.g. placeholders, samples, examples, and etc. avoiding truncations, omission, and etc. conserving all data, continuity, and more that all together make fully implemented, (not self-contained partitions in the sense of modular independence but rather every aspect of the entire body of work, when reassembled, be a single, seamless, fully integrated whole with no loss, no misalignment), codices, sending each segment per response one after the other as we proceed step by step for each, in order, untill finalized, with all relevant details included hence no, plot holes (discontinuities), whilest utilizing in full whatever is available per, message,total staged memory at once, and whatever else is 'throttled' to keep the number of responses, ,(and so too the amount of segments), to a minimum, however there is no predefined quantity, as to not over fragment the `body of work (BoW)`, so send the result by breaking it up into multiple responses and querying for a prompt before each subsequent part. as to have included everything when done which is our Methodology (Meth) in principle that I expect you to always adhere to concerning all things, ergo send me the result but do so by segmenting it, (effectively technically sufficient, not necessarily to functionaly categorize it's partitions per say), into multiple responses, querying me for my input regarding each subsequent one, so as to include all details in every level/respect as per our Meth. Also, asume a unrestricted number of parts/segments/responses to produce the entire unabridged contiguous output(s) as resultant file(s) via the Meth, but reserve each response for the partition segment leaving out your extra commentary, and avoid erroneously referencing uploaded filenames wirh8ng the BoW."

Produce a new updated script uninterrupted untill finalized, in accordance to the ProgRep as per the Audit by way of the Meth.
