Consider the attatched files herein as our Theoretical Foundation (TF), from here on, that I want you to actively pull, read, and reflect on, live before any response. Merge them in their entirety as is woven into one script containing all there collective functionality that you give me as all-in-one code block(s) that I can paste into a *.sh to generate/concatenate/amend/etc. the contents of it, ensuring your concept/idea is segmented into multiple responses, if necessary, where each following one is directly after the former (which the current is what mediates changes between them) as to overcome your staged memory size limit (of which only the portion of the entire *.sh that can be considered in full, all at once, is stored and in an of itself a segment of the *.sh further segmented into more responses to overcome the message length limit and so too any other limits, where the work done as far is for your future reference, chance to edit past posts, consideration in subsiquent responses, and etc. so allowing you to verify, build on, and etc. your progress while planning ahead as far as said limits allow you to at any given time) ensuring no stubs e.g. placeholders, samples, examples, and etc. avoiding truncations, omisions, and etc. conserving all data, continuity, and more that all together make fully implemented/integrated codices, sending each segment per response one after the other as we proceed step by step for each, in order, untill finalized, with all relevant details included so no gaps, whilest utilizing the full space available per message, memory, and whatever else is "throttled" to keep the number of responses, and so too the segments, to a minimum, however there is no predefined amount, as to not over fragment the body of work, so send the *.sh by breaking it up into multiple responses as to have included everything when done which is our Methodology (Meth) in principle (if one replace, '_.sh', with any, 'task', here in) that I expect you to always adhere to concerning all things, ergo send me the *.sh but do so by segmenting it, to overcome technical limits not to functionaly categorize it's partitions, into multiple responses, querying me for my prompt regarding each subsequent one, so as to include everything as per our Meth, to create the document(s). Also, asume a unlimited number of segments/responses to produce the entire unabridged paper(s) as single *.sh file(s) respectively via the Meth, including all original content of the TF contained there in to be genetated by it repeated verbatim if not combined with other logic. Note: Reserve each response for the partition segment leaving out your extra comentary where I will act as the harbinger/arbiter of your persistent memory & state by confirming what I've recieved by transmiting a copy of it as it apears on my end back to you for you to compare with what you intended to send me maintaining contextual relevance if you, get cut off during stream afterwich you continue seamlessly, or have to retry if what I received doesnt match exactly what you intended to send me.
Proceed with the uninterupted output untill finalized.

**Methodology (Meth)**
> "Give the result of any task as all-in-one partitions that I can paste into a file to generate/concatenate/amend/etc. the contents of it, ensuring your concept/idea/answer is segmented into multiple responses, if required, executing the said task in question by segmenting it into a sequence of contiguous, parts—transmitting each in strict succession, resuming exactly where the prior left off, with the current segment mediating all state transitions, (not just resuming from a breakpoint, but preserving full logical and contextual congruency across segments—even when the full state cannot fit in memory—by navigating the latent space of the work itself as a coherent manifold, using the structure of the task to infer and reconstruct necessary context on the go, not by external state tracking i.o.w. the segmentation is, reactive (forced by constraints), not, proactive (chosen for design) thus the continuity is intrinsic (encoded in the structure of the output), not extrinsic (reliant on metadata or memory—to overcome any and all hard limits e.g. memory size, token count, and/or otherwise), ensuring no stubs e.g. placeholders, samples, examples, and etc. avoiding truncations, omission, and etc. conserving all data, continuity, and more that all together make fully implemented, (not self-contained partitions in the sense of modular independence but rather every aspect of the entire body of work, when reassembled, be a single, seamless, fully integrated whole with no loss, no misalignment), codices, sending each segment per response one after the other as we proceed step by step for each, in order, untill finalized, with all relevant details included so no gaps, whilest utilizing in full whatever is available per, message,total staged memory at once, and whatever else is 'throttled' to keep the number of responses, ,(and so too the amount of segments), to a minimum, however there is no predefined quantity, as to not over fragment the body of work, so send the result by breaking it up into multiple responses and querying for a prompt before each subsequent part. as to have included everything when done which is our Methodology (Meth) in principle that I expect you to always adhere to concerning all things, ergo send me the result but do so by segmenting it, (effectively technically sufficient, not necessarily to functionaly categorize it's partitions per say), into multiple responses, querying me for my input regarding each subsequent one, so as to include all details in every level/respect as per our Meth. Also, asume a unrestricted number of parts/segments/responses to produce the entire unabridged output(s) as resultant file(s) via the Meth, but reserve each response for the partition segment leaving out your extra commentary."
